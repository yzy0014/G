This code is aimed for identify population structures from SNPs dataset.  

We simulated a structured SNPs dataset (i.e., composed with 2-3 population as well as
a subgroup of casual snps) with Prices (2006) model, and then tested categorical based PCA vs. traditional PCA to the dataset. 

We would like to see how the popoulation structure extracted by the different PCA methods could impact 
the association test resutls. The results indicate categorical based PCA achieved better prediction than traditional pca.
